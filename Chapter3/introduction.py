# Unsupervised learning subumes all kinds of machine learning
# where there is no known output, no teacher

# Types of unsupervised learning
# 1. Transformation and 2. Clustering

# Transformation creates a new representation of dataset so the new dataset will likely 
# easier to understand or represented to some visual extent
# For example, tracking the discussion of themes.

# Clustering algorithms, make a data partition into distinct groups
# of similar items. For example, organizing photos on social media
