    "    - Common application: dimensionality reduction: finds a new way to represent the data that still summarize the essential characteristics with fewer features.\n",
    "    - Another application: finding parts or components that \"make up\" the data. ex: topic extraction on collections of documents. Find the unknown topics. Useful for sentiment analysis, etc.\n",
    "- Clustering algorithms: partition data into distinc groups of similar items. Application: for grouping photos in social media."
